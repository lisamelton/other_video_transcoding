# Other Video Transcoding

Other tools to transcode videos.

> [!NOTE]
> *This project is still being maintained but development is not very active. Why? Because I'm focusing my energy on the redesigned and rewritten version of `transcode-video.rb` from my [Video Transcoding](https://github.com/lisamelton/video_transcoding) project. And I would recommend using that tool instead of `other-transcode.rb` because it's much less complex while still leveraging the modern era of transcoding technology.*

## About

Hi, I'm [Lisa Melton](http://lisamelton.net/). I created this project to transcode my collection of Blu-ray Discs and DVDs into a smaller, more portable format while remaining high enough quality to be mistaken for the originals.

The `other-transcode.rb` tool in this project automatically selects a platform-specific hardware-based video encoder rather than relying on a slower software-based encoder.

Using an encoder built into a CPU or video card means that even Blu-ray Disc-sized media can be transcoded 5 to 10 times faster than its original playback speed, depending on which hardware is available.

Because `other-transcode.rb` leverages [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/), many hardware platforms are supported including:

* [Nvidia NVENC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_NVENC)
* [Intel Quick Sync Video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Quick_Sync_Video)
* [AMD Video Coding Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Coding_Engine)
* [Apple VideoToolbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/videotoolbox)

And many features are supported including:

* High quality 10-bit [HEVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding) encoding on recent generations of Nvidia and Intel hardware
* 8-bit HEVC encoding on other hardware platforms
* Hardware-based video decoding for improved performance
* Fallback to software video encoding when appropriate hardware is not available
* Optional automatic and reliable video cropping
* Adding audio and subtitle tracks by language or title
* [Dolby Digital Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Digital_Plus) (Enhanced AC-3) audio encoding
* Burning image-based subtitles into video output to ease player compatibility

Additional documentation for this project is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/lisamelton/other_video_transcoding/wiki).

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> *Older versions of this project were packaged via [RubyGems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems) and installed via the `gem` command. If you had it installed that way, it's a good idea to uninstall that version via this command: `gem uninstall other_video_transcoding`*

> [!WARNING]
> _Avoid installing within [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) such as the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) since access to hardware video encoders may not be allowed, severely impacting performance._

The `other-transcode.rb` tool works on Windows, Linux and macOS. It's a standalone Ruby script which must be installed and updated manually. You can retrieve it via the command line by cloning the entire repository like this:

    git clone https://github.com/lisamelton/other_video_transcoding.git

Or download it directly from the GitHub website here:

https://github.com/lisamelton/other_video_transcoding

On Linux and macOS, make sure `other-transcode.rb` is executable by setting its permissions like this:

    chmod +x other-transcode.rb

And then move or copy `other-transcode.rb` to a directory listed in your `$env:PATH` environment variable on Windows or `$PATH` environment variable on Linux and macOS.

Because it's written in Ruby, `other-transcode.rb` requires that language's runtime and interpreter. See "[Installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)" if you don't have it on your platform.

Additional software is required for `other-transcode.rb` to function properly, specifically these command line programs:

* `ffprobe`
* `ffmpeg`
* `mkvpropedit`

Optional crop previewing also requires the `mpv` command line program.

See "[Download FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)," "[MKVToolNix Downloads](https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html)" and "[mpv Installation](https://mpv.io/installation/)" to find versions for your platform.

Additional documentation for installing these programs on Windows is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/lisamelton/other_video_transcoding/wiki/Windows).

[Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) containers for Linux, including installation instructions, are available here:

https://skj.dev/container/other-transcode

On macOS, all of these programs can be easily installed via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), an optional package manager:

    brew install ffmpeg
    brew install mkvtoolnix
    brew install mpv

The `ffprobe` program is included within the `ffmpeg` package and the `mkvpropedit` program is included within the `mkvtoolnix` package.

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> Recent changes to Nvidia drivers, versions 555.85 and later, have a bug (or feature?) which ignores target bitrates for HEVC output so that only constant quality values are honored. H.264 output is not affected. Until this is fixed, always add the `--nvenc-cq` option to your command line when using the Nvidia HEVC encoder. Otherwise the encoder will ignore the default bitrate and do something undefined.

The `other-transcode.rb` tool has over 50 command line options. Use `--help` to list the options available along with brief instructions on their usage:

    other-transcode.rb --help

More options are available with:

    other-transcode.rb --help more

And the full set of options is available with:

    other-transcode.rb --help full

The `other-transcode.rb` tool automatically determines target video bitrate, main audio track configuration, etc. without any command line options, so using it can be as simple as this on Windows:

    other-transcode.rb C:\Rips\Movie.mkv

Or this on Linux and macOS:

    other-transcode.rb /Rips/Movie.mkv

On completion that command creates its output in the current working directory:

    Movie.mkv

Use the `--hevc` option to create HEVC video:

    other-transcode.rb --hevc C:\Rips\Movie.mkv

High quality 10-bit HEVC is automatically selected when using the Nvidia and Intel encoders.

Use the `--eac3` option to create Dolby Digital Plus audio:

    other-transcode.rb --eac3 C:\Rips\Movie.mkv
